Optional:clone the app 



open app folder.then Jobs folder and open job item file.just copy the code

Correction Your code:
where you mapped filtedteredJobs data ,go there and just remove this filteredJobs.map .
import jobItem where you mapped filteredJobs.

step two: 
change your Job provider that i already added  under jobs folder
change your context. i have written it under context folder

Finally , properly wrap your main app by JobProvider and all import correctly

NOTE: it is a next js project. i use it just for send data .
